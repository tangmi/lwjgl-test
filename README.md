==========

an illegitimate almost MVC game written in openGL.

to set up eclipse, follow [this guide](https://github.com/tangmi/gamestudy/blob/master/readme.md#setting-up-dev-environment), ignoring any slick2d reference (you only need to add the LWJGL libraries, this project is looking for a user library called "LWJGL 2.8.5")
